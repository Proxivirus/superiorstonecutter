# Superior Stonecutter
A Minecraft datapack to expand upon the recipes of the stonecutter, and add additional recipes

# <p align="center">What is Superior Stonecutter?
</p>

**<p align="center">Superior Stonecutter is an extensive stonecutter expansion datapack. It expands on the existing vanilla recipes by adding extra ways to craft things (from simple things like the highly requested deepslate cutting, to crazy stuff like crafting a stair into its slab equivalent). It also adds something I like to call "side-crafting", which is similar to uncrafting, but much more balanced. Superior Stonecutter also includes woodcutting functionality because Mojang won't give it to us. On top of all that, there's built-in compatibility for all your favorite mods!**

**<p align="center">See below for a more thorough dive into all the available features:**

## üî©Deepslate Cutting
**<p align="center">This part is short but sweet. Adds the ability to cut normal deepslate instead of just cobbled deepslate.**

## ü™öWoodcutting

**<p align="center">Woodcutting allows your stonecutter to cut wood (it's in the name).**

**<p align="center">Put in a logs, planks, and even other wood block(see advanced recycling section) and craft anything from stairs to sticks!**

**<p align="center">Includes proper balancing for the halved crafting output of bamboo.**

## ‚ôªAdvanced Recycling

**<p align="center">Advanced Recycling is where I try to bring some real world logic into funny block game. You should be able to turn a stair into a slab, and now you can!**



**<p align="center">You can even recycle it all the way down to sticks if you're using a wood item.**

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qCUKVw5.gif" width="700" alt="advanced recycling for various wood items">

**<p align="center">And it's all balanced with math that occasionally hurt my brain to do (3 doors and 2 trapdoors cost the same amount to craft in a crafting table in vanilla Minecraft. Why??? How am I supposed to balance that üò≠)**

## üõ†Ô∏èSide-crafting

**<p align="center">Side-crafting allows you to switch between block variants in a balanced way.** 

**<p align="center">For example, you can turn stone into stone bricks and turn it back into stone.**

**<p align="center">But if you turn stone into cobblestone, you can't switch it back because you would need to smelt it.**

**<p align="center">Same with blocks like smooth stone.**

**<p align="center">This feature is also supported with blocks like stairs, slabs, and walls!**

## ‚õèÔ∏èCopper
**<p align="center">
Why is copper in its own section? Because its got some special features just for it!**

**<p align="center">Normally, the only way to remove wax or an oxidization layer from copper is with an axe. This can take a while if you have a lot of copper blocks. But now, it doesn't have to.**


### <p align="center">If your copper block is waxed, run it through the stonecutter to remove the wax.

### <p align="center">Then you can run it through the stonecutter more to remove oxidization layers. (You can remove one at a time)
